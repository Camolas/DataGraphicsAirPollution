##### open Pollution_Earth.html in your browser, inside Pollution_Project folder, cd Pollution_Project in commands console 

if this not works in cmd run: python3 -m http.server or python -m http.server
to create a browser. 

just to be explicit - Yes, the error is saying you cannot point your browser directly at file://some/path/some.html

Here are some options to quickly spin up a local web server to let your browser render local files

Python 2
If you have Python installed...

Change directory into the folder where your file some.html or file(s) exist using the command cd /path/to/your/folder

Start up a Python web server using the command python -m SimpleHTTPServer

This will start a web server to host your entire directory listing at http://localhost:8000

You can use a custom port  python -m SimpleHTTPServer 9000 giving you link: http://localhost:9000
This approach is built in to any Python installation.
